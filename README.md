## Data Structures

In this section, you'll find notebooks that cover various data structures such as:

- **Array**: Introduction to arrays, operations, and applications.
- **Linked List**: Singly and doubly linked lists, operations like insertion, deletion, and traversal.
- **Binary Tree**: Implementations of binary trees, traversals (in-order, pre-order, post-order), and applications.
- **Graph**: Representation of graphs (adjacency matrix, adjacency list), depth-first search (DFS), breadth-first search (BFS), and more.

## Algorithms

This section includes notebooks demonstrating key algorithms, such as:

- **Sorting**: Implementations of bubble sort, quicksort, merge sort, and others.
- **Searching**: Binary search, linear search, and search algorithms on trees and graphs.
- **Dynamic Programming**: Solutions to common DP problems like Fibonacci, knapsack problem, and longest common subsequence.
- **Graph Traversal**: Implementations of DFS, BFS, and shortest path algorithms.

## Machine Learning

This section focuses on practical implementations of machine learning algorithms, including:

- **Linear Regression**: Simple linear regression, multiple linear regression, and cost functions.
- **Logistic Regression**: Binary classification, sigmoid function, and model evaluation.
- **Decision Tree**: Decision tree classifiers and regression, pruning, and model evaluation.
- **Reinforcement Learning**: Q-learning and other RL algorithms for problem-solving and game playing.

## How to Use
